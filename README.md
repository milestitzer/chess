# chess
This was a recreational project I did starting with beginner-level Python knowledge. It was a huge undertaking that took me longer than I would like to say, but I was able to create a command line-based version of object-oriented Chess that you can play with a friend. Upon running my code, you will be prompted to enter the coordinates (row and column as labeled on the type-printed board) of the piece you would like to move and where you would like to move it to. These prompts will be repeated for each move until one person resigns. The program is fully equipped with functions that identify illegal moves based on what piece one is attempting to move where in accordance with all of the rules of chess. This includes castling, en passant, and promotion. It will also identify coordinates that do not correspond to a piece on the board and redirect. Perhaps in the future I will introduce a GUI that allows players to select the piece they would like to move with their mouse. 

As seriously as I took this project I also had a lot of fun with it, and I really hope you like the finished product half as much as I do.
